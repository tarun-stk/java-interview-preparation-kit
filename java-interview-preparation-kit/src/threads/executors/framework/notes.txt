Notes:
    Thread pool:
        Fixed number of pre initialized threads, waiting to perform a task.
        Benefits:
            Better resource management: instead of creating boundless number of threads, it creates only finite number of threads and reuses them

Disadvantages of traditional usage of threads:
    Manual thread management
    resource management
    scalability
    thread reuse
    error handling

Differences between execute of Executor and submit of ExecutorService:
    execute:
        works similar to submit to submit a task
        is of void type
    submit:
        works to submit a taks
        returns Future type of object.
        Using Future you can do some useful stuff, like to get what the task has returned using get()
        and whenever you do get(), it will wait if the task is not completed, once completed it will return the output
        or to check if the task submission is done or not using isDone() method

        submit is an overloaded method taking Runnable in one method, and Callable in other method

Difference between Runnable and Callable:
    Runnable:
        abstract method run()
        run() is a void method
        if any exception causing code is writtent inside this overriden method, we must surround using try/catch,
            because we cannot add throws to method sign as it is not there Runnable interface
    Callable:
        abstract method call()
        has a generic return type to its method
        has throws Exception in method sign, so we can simply write exception causing code, without usign try/catch block.
