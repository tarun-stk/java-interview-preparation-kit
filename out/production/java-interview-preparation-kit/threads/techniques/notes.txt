Notes on executor framework:
    This came into pic because using traditional multi threading we were creating new threads whenever we need
    So, we were creating boundless no of threads, and also creating and destroying threads is a expensive task

    Problems solved by executors frameword:
    We can create finite no of threads and store them in threadpool
    Threads can be reused so creating and destrying operations are not required


    Executor - interface
    ExecutorService - interface extends Executor
        methods:
            execute(Runnable r) - by using this we actually submit a task
            shutdown()
            shutdownNow()
            submit(Runnable r)
    Executors - class
        methods:
            newFixedThreadPool(nThreads)
            newCachedThreadPool()
            newSingleThreadExecutor()
    Function - interface
