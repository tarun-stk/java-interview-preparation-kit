Implicit/Intrinsic locking:
    - Blocks other threads, until current thread completes it execution
    - Builltin locking mechanism achieved using synchronized keyword
    - Not possible to interrupt current threads execution externally by other thread
    - Fairness of locks not possible
    - Read/write locking not possible

Explicit:
    - Will not block other threads, when using tryLock to acquire lock
    - Manual lock achieved using Lock interface
    - Possible to interrupt other threads exec by calling lockInterruptly method on current thread
    - Fairness of locks possible
    - Read/write locking possible by maintaining different locks
